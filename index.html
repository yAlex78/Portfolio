            As of June 2021, Alexander Yao is a rising senior at Monta Vista High School. Although his real name is Alexander,
            he prefers to go by Alex, as he thinks that it is much shorter and easier to say/write. Alex hopes to major in 
            computer science in the future, and has spent many years learning programming and computer science. In his free 
            time, Alex enjoys listening to music and taking photos. Usually, the photos he takes are of various scenery that
            he finds pretty or calming to look at. <a href = "alexPhotos.html">Click here to see some of the photos that Alex has taken.</a>

            Music is also a big part of Alex's life, as he started playing piano at the
            age of six and became a percussionist when he was in fourth grade. Since then, Alex has played in multiple ensembles
            and orchestras as a percussionist.

            Overall, Alex is a very quiet person and prefers to do things by himself in a quiet space. He values
            the tranquility that comes from being in a silent setting.
